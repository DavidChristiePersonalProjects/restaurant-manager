# restaurant-manager

Currently this only contains the protype version of a RESTful menu manager.

The menu manager API alows menus, menu categories (i.e. Starters), and menu items (i.e. Bowl of soup) to be created, updated, and deleted.

The project was created using NetBeans 8.2 and tested using Postman.  A collection of API calls have been exported from Postman and is available in the root folder.
